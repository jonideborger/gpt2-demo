[Intro: Kanye West & André 3000]
You know I just wanna see you grow up
I guess the best way is so get along with
Me and my mama's car
Driving around town talking
Telling the mamma that we got a problem
That we had a problem (Golly!)


[Chorus: Kanye West & Metro]
Golly, I think I remember that
Golly, I think I remember that
She put that necklace on that she found on the floor
It was a dead giveaway that that necklace
I woke up one morning
And I'ma need to kiss her grave
Cause 'round the corner, I'm on the corner
I'm on the corner, and only me
Can get to kiss the god-sower
And only me can get to touch that
How the gosh! God's a virgin
Now, where my family? Where my mommy?
Now, where da nauta?
Baby, tell me where I'm going
When I'm on the other side of the globe


[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I know it's May, I know it's Pelé, I know it's in Paris
I heard the romance between andold go down
Maybe it's the weight off your shoulders, or your determination
That's the light that you're getting
Golly, I just hope you catch the sunrise
Eye, eye, eye, that all means the world jolly good time
'Til death do us part, you treat me like our favorite
Then get on that death row, somebody gon' love me wrong
I'm a real queen, stop it
I'm a real queen, stop it
I'm a real queen, stop it
Then get on that death row, somebody gon' love me wrong
Oh, now I'm the queen
And you the bitch 'round town
Who gon' love me? Trust me
I'm the devil
And you the reptile, then they gon' love me wrong
WOOHOO!


[Chorus: Kanye West & Metro]
Golly, I think I remember that
Golly, I think I remember that
Oh, I need to make that paprika go away
Oh, I need to make that paprika go away
She put that necklace on that she found on that floor
It was a dead-end street
I woke up one morning
And I'ma need to kiss her grave
Cause 'round the corner, I'm on the corner
I'm on the corner, and only me
Can get to kiss the god-sower
And only me can get to touch that
How the gosh! God's a virgin
Now, where my family? Where my mother-in-law?
I'm on the corner
And only me, now where
I need it
Where I'm from, I need it

[Outro: Slick Rick J]
BlazN They forget all about you
They forget all about you
BlazN You forget all about me
They forget all about you
You forget all about me
Oh no, don't say no to me
Oh, don't say no to me
Oh, don't say no to me
Never forget or live with a life of your own
Never forget or live with a life of your own


[Intro: Slick Rick J]
BlazN I forgot all about you
Never did I think you'd want to
I forgot all about you
I can tell you're up to your own linchpin
I don't wanna run from you


[Verse: Kanye West]
She claiming that I don't know (Damn)
I know she don't love you
I went to church all to herself
Says I don't know (Damn)
But I don't love you at all
Says I don't know (Damn)
But I don't love you at all






[Intro: Slick Rick J]
I love you, love you
Oh no, don't say no
No to all that gonna see me
Oh, don't say no to all that gonna see me
Oh, don't say no to all that gonna see me


[Outro: Kanye West]
I love you, love you
In my experience, the opposite of loving
Is never love, never love


[Verse: Kanye West]
She claiming that I don't know (Damn) (Damn)
Oh, I don't know (Damn)


[Chorus: Kanye West, Mr. Hudson & Swizz Beatz]
