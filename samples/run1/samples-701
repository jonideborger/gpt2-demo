When I rapped on "Ja Nola" I'd rap on "Nola." But this past May I rapped on Kanye West's song "Let It Be." And on May 30th I made a video for Apple Music, where I got the beat. And it's called 'Drop Kanye.' You know the beat, every beat I make, I made a rap track on it. And on May 30, I had to take my family by the hand by car. So much so, that day I had to take my cousin by the hand too. Because he was just so inconsiderate in the face of the worst uhh, he took his cousin by the hand AND made a music video for it. So good night!


[Intro]
Uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh uh
E-mail me if you need advice
I always vibe old right?
Told you so many good ones
Don't you dare to bring that brand new "Oo" to life
A little too much into the looks of y'all' friends
You know the older ones looked like they came from a cave
The studio vaults were full of shit
The studio has always felt empty
I dunno what everybody saying to that, it's like the Titanic
Or the Green Line was closed
I dunno what everybody saying to that, it's like the Chi-Town
I dunno what everybody saying to that, it's like the Red Rock
Mama said keep it up, keep it blazing
Just let me peek right through the glass
I said, "Hi, I'm Justine"


[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare, myself, myself


[Verse 2]
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
This is why a nigga walk away with a Klondike, huh
They look like they came from a different place
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself


[Chorus]
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself


[Outro]
Have you ever popped a can of Barkers?
Barkers is the number one necessity
That's why I spend my money on earphones
Have you ever heard of, you know
 the name K-Rock?
He's the number one necessity
That's why I spend my money on earphones
Have you ever heard of, you know
 the name K-Rock?
He's the number one necessity
That's why I spend my money on earphones
Have you ever heard of, you know
 the name K-Rock?
He's the number one necessity
That's why I spend my money on earphones
Have you ever heard of, you know

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I said, "Money is power" (Money is power!)
And I'm back on TV and you can't tell who's boss
You can't tell who's champ, who's champs
You can't tell who's on lockdown, who on patrol
I'm saying it like...
"The media is the same way"
