 sign!
I'm tryna take her in threesome
And make them say "now, get your ass up off this wall"
Takin' all the cash, get some lattes
And they come at you like "look, we got cash"
Right?


[Bridge: Brandy]
But if my nigga can pronounce "word"
And put all his emphasis on the same word
Then I'm gonna be lost in the crowd


[Hook: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey sample]
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
(I'm a billionaire! I'm a financier!)
I'm a financier! I'm a financier!
C'mon!
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)
(I'm a billionaire! I'm a financier!)
I'm a financier! I'm a financier!
C'mon!
(Diamonds are forever forever forever)


[Verse 2: Kanye West]
People askin' me is I still gon' give my all to the cause

Chloe (I love you forever, forever, forever)


[Hook: Kanye West]
But if you'd kindly assist me in my time at Merrill Lynch

I have just over a million hits a year
And if I'm gonna jam, I'm gonna get packs
So I'ma need a certain amount of hits
And a certain amount of hooks
And I'ma need a certain amount of hooks
And I get married in the woods
And we be together again
But my hymns is bittersweet
'Cause my song "Chloe"
Oops, it's not... not!
Is it? I was listening
Just to a song, and a dream
Scared of the future, over-thinking it
And overanalyzing it
You know the hard way
You read, you're looking for it
'Cause the emotion is killing you
Screamin', "No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no; no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no; no, no, no, no; knock knock
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no; knock knock
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no)


[Outro: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make it famous, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make it famous, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make it famous, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh








[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
How could you be so heartless?


[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You wanna see somebody more heartful
Middle finger in the face when the doors't in


[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so Dr. Evil in the night life
Could you be honest with me?
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You wanna see somebody more heartful
Middle finger in the face when the doors't in


[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil in the night life
Could you be so honest as the night life
Could you be so kind as the night life
The night life, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Lady Godiva just shot an R&B girl
You can't
