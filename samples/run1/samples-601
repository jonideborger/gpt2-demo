======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I'm like, "Oh, shit!', shit!
You don't believe me, man!
Let me help you with the part where you're dressed up like I'm the whole cast off The 100
Yeah, I'm lookin' all up on my Vibe
Pink polos, turnt all over your dress
You don't believe me, man!
Let me help you with the part where you look all up on my Vibe
Yeah, I'm lookin' all up on my Vibe
Pink polos, pink polos, pink polos
You don't believe me, man!






[Intro: Kanye West]
Eats like my baby, this is the first time I ate your baby
You're not a baby, you're a grown man
I'ma look in the mirror and tell you that you were special
I'ma make sure that you don't turn me down again
And that I don't give you up, I mean my word
How do you act when you look up from your paper and smiles
And I look up to you on a thousand counts
And I know that you're thinking
I should have told you in the first place
Was I talkin' 'bout out of my mind?
'Cause I was cryin' 'b out
I think he should have never told you
But I feel so bad for you
I feel bad for you if I tell you
Don't tell anybody, man
Don't tell anybody, man
Don't tell anybody, man
Don't tell anybody, man


[Chorus: Kanye West, Mr. Hudson, Kid Cudi]
Beautiful, breathe in, breathe out
For the love of y'all, cause I know you're tired of me
For the love of y'all, cause I know you're tired of me
No more wars, no more fistfights, no more collisions
Give me the energy to make this my life or die
No more trips to the doctor, no more visits to the stomach
No more peer pressure, no more, "Give me a whiz when I go fast?"
Just like people, I mean you!


[Outro: Kanye West & Kid Cudi]
Beautiful, breathe in, breathe out
For the love of y'all, cause I know you're tired of me
For the love of y'all, cause I know you're tired of me
No more wars, no more war, no more fistfights
Give me the energy to make this my life or die
No more trips to the doctor, no more visits to the stomach
No more peer pressure, no more, "Give me a whiz when I go fast?"
Just like people, I mean you!






[Intro]
God is
My light, his breath is my strength
They ask me, tell them, how did you get so committed?
Show them the door, they'll look at me from the other side
As they looking at me from the other side
They asking me, how did you, how did you, how did you, did you?
When the war comes
When the dust settles
When the dust settles


[Chorus]
I just wanna be a hero
I wanna be a hero in the American Dream
I just wanna be a hero in the American Dream
I just wanna be a hero in the American Dream
I just wanna be a hero in the American Dream


(Yes, yes, yes,)
I just wanna be a hero, too
I just wanna be a hero in the American Dream
I just wanna be a hero in the American Dream


(Yes, yes, yes, yes)


[Verse 1]
It's the night that blue sky, the color of august sky
I've been woken from deep
Ohh, the lights of this world have been giving me away
I'm uppity as dust now
Taking my valedictorian picture
With a big booty arrogant
It's the night I born on a field scholarship
I'm uppity as dust now
Taking my valedictorian picture
With a big booty arrogant
It's the night I born on a field scholarship
I'm uppity as dust now
Taking my valedictorian picture
With a big booty arrogant


[Chorus]
I just wanna be a hero
(A hero in the truest faith)
I just wanna be a hero in the truest
Usain Bolt
I wanna be B.I.G.'s Boyz II Girl
I just wanna be a hero in the truest

(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)


[Verse 2]
For every head, there's
