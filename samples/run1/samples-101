======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 might never make a movie with my hands over the stove
I love the way his hands just wiggled up my dresser
You can always get a free taste if you want
If I ever let you down
We gonna see y'all in the movie theater
With these hoes on my back like The Streets Are The New Black
My mama had a threesome like the Jetsons
Let's give her one of these


[Outro: Lil Wayne & The Weeknd]
La la la la, la la la, la la, la la
La la la la la, la la la, la la, la
La la la la la, ho-ha, ho-ha, ho-ha
Now she got a plan, she don't need to ask me for it
But I think the story is very well told
La la la la, ho-ha, ho-ha
I just wish they had some songs that were different
'Til she get possessed, possessed
Now she get possessed, possessed
With these hoes on my back like The Streets Are The New Black
My mama had a threesome like the Jetsons
Let's give her one of these






[Refrain: Rihanna & Kanye West]
La la la la, la la l'a, la l'a
La la la, ho-ha, ho-ha, ho-ha (La la la)
La la la, ho-ha, ho-ha (La la la, ho-ha)
Now she get possessed, possessed
With these hoes on my back like The Streets Are The New Black
'Til she get possessed, possessed
Now she get possessed, possessed, possessed
Now she get possessed, possessed


[Refrain: Kanye West]
La la la la, ho-ha, ho-ha, la la la l'a
La la la la, la la la, ho-ha, ho-ha
(La la la l'a, ho-ha, ho-ha, ho-ha)
And we gon' do another one
Okay, okay, okay, okay
I'ma have to do another one, okay
I'ma have to do another one, okay
I'ma have to do another one
Okay, okay, okay, okay
I'ma have to do another one, okay
I'ma have to do another one, okay








[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh


[Striking sound]
Well, how shall we begin?


[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Yo, you know me from the movies
I still look and talk like I look back on old photos
And when people tell me who I look up to
That mean I lose a bit of weight, I guess


[Chorus: Kanye West (w/ Young Jeezy)]
Oh, ho-ha-ha, ho-ha-ha, ho-ha-ha
Uh
I never could have imagined that
It came up in my mind
It was always a theme
My love like, "Oh yeah, this is what I wanted"
That's why I've been running it through my whole career
I can tell you're gon' tell me where the line is
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ho-ha-ha, ho-ha-ha, ho-ha-ha
Uh
I never thought I'd make it to this stage
Maybe I could've made it to this stage
Or the one that got me
To this degree
I never thought I'd make it to this stage
Maybe I could've made it to this stage
Or the one that got me
To this degree


[Verse 4: Kanye West]
No, n-n-now, it's okay
So far ahead, we go
No, n-n-now, it's okay
So far ahead, we go
No, n-n-now, it's okay
So far ahead, we go
No, n-n-now, it's okay
So far ahead, we go
No, n-n-now, it's okay


[Chorus: Kanye West (w/ Young Jeezy)]
Oh, ho-ha-ha, ho-ha-ha
Uh
I never thought I'd make it to this stage
Maybe I'd made it to this stage
Maybe I could've made it to this stage
Or the one that got me
To this degree
I never thought I'd make it to this stage
Maybe I'd made it to this stage
Or the one that got me








[Clapping]
Uhh, why me again?
Uhh... why, why?
