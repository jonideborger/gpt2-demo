 me
No one gon' be too proud to see me gunned down
I been doing what I wanted, now what the Feds
Do they know now? I out of my mind
I'm still in my mind
I don't know what it all mean, don't tell anyone
You gotta let me know, girl
I'm on my mind, I don't know
What it all mean, don't tell anybody
You gotta let me know, girl


[Chorus: Kanye West & Dwele]
I just wanna be a real boy
And you can't tell me nothing
Mayonnaise-colored, Prince-colored, R&B pharaoh
Got you stuck in this nightmare
What it all mean, don't tell anyone
You gotta let me know, girl
I'm on my mind, I don't know
What it all mean, don't tell anyone
You gotta let me know, girl


[Outro]
You know what it mean, don't tell anybody
You gotta let me know, girl
I'm just wanna be a real boy, you gotta let me know






[Intro: Johnny "Guitar" Watson & Junie Morrison]
Now, I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
But I always had a tip: if I flashed a gun, you'd turn your weapon away
I was in the exact position I wanted you to be
I'm saying it again, more than once
"I'm not serious, I'm just having a fun time"
You know what, I got the family in the news
And as they say in Miami, we dig a grave
So now they (my kids) got the boot, here's the plan
We ain't letting you tag along alone 'cause we like to dawg
We hustle, we scream, we fuck, we like it
We hate the new Spike Jonze, you know that shit
We hate the new Jay on a daily basis
I'm saying it again, more than once
"I'm not serious, I'm just having a fun time"
You know what, these fake news niggas
They been putting shit down for the past week
Snatched all the stacks from the Asian market
Now I'm doin' the dishes, get the message out
Getting the word out, get the word out
There's no one expert, just me
I'm just doin' the bitches
Just touch daisies, I got girls I know
I don't know what she gon' say, like a 50 Shades
She got a big brother that she're married with
And I don't know what the fans want
I gotta let them know, I'm the boss
And they can't stop the rumors
I'm just doin' the bitches


[Hook: Kanye West]
Everybody, now that this video has been shared
More than a million times that I've watched it
I have a code that I like better
People talking shit, calling me murder
What could you say to that?,"He that what you propose is good
And you gon' say what you like better than me
George Foreman."


[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm hardly ever on my toes
Never had a beef, but the fistfight spilled over
And she got me thinking like home
Runaway the like-got-a-good home
Is everything bubble gum, Everybody, move on

[Hook: Kanye West]
We broke, broke broke, broke
More than a million times that I've watched it
I have a code that I like better
People talking shit, calling me murder
What could you say to that?
,"He that what you propose is good
And you gon' say what you like better than me
George Foreman."


[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to soldiers
One cuff link, stay put
Hit it, drive it, download it
Fly it, play it, make it better
You get a starstruck man when you try to starstruck me
Hit the bitches, hit the drinks, wait for the fans
Hey, they got the goods, here's the deal
I'm a free agent, here's the deal
I'm a free agent, here's the deal
My bread's still on the line, 'cause I'm a soldier
And the only bread's on the line is this
Don't tell me, you can't tell me
Tell me what kind of robot you want me with
My only bread's is this, I don't have no choice
But I can't stop the show, can you leave
You two wild, wild sides, Adam West
Devil-
