======== SAMPLE 1 ========

You need to put them heads together and work your magic
This could be one helluva job!
I'm asking about your dog, his reaction went up
He went and got his buddy Tim Cook, who he got
Crack-a-daisy, I said, "Yo man, Kwe, that nigga is loaded!"
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the chain they went through
Selling beef, and my heart was in the right place
It was a right, it was a store call that picked me up
But I was heading to Chicago, I know they pick up where we
I got a Mercedes sedan, so they call me Gap
And the first three letters are H, Y, and Z, I tried to talk to my dad
He told me go to the store, go to work, go to bed, he didn't answer my phone
I called up my dad, I told him to knock it off, he called again
This time I answered the phone like my 5 brother, he called again, he called again
This time I answered the phone like my brother


[Hiphop: "Dawg, yo we going broke?]
Pour a little champagne on top of my glass
You dirty mouth is killing me
I telling you why I'm so angry
How could you be so judgmental? You an idiot, you ain't know
Facts don't write the game, you don't need to look at the clock
You an idiot, you an idiot, you an-ist, you piece-me-all-I'mall an umbrella
You don't know how you gettingost?
Agatha, you're the devil's child, get on down
You don't know how you being private
You an-a saying it like it's school


[Hiphop: "I'm private if you need me, I'm an idiot]
Pour a little champagne on top of my glass
You an-a saying it like it's Catholic if you don't already
You an-a seeing me private if you need me
I'm private if you need me, I'm an idiot


[Verse 2: Jay and Co.]
Private if you need me, I'm an idiot
I know you want it all, you always fuck with the girls
I know you want it all, you always fuck with the girls
Private if you need me, I'm an idiot
I know you want it all, you always fuck with the girls
I know you want it all, you always fuck with the girls


[Hiphop]
Whatcha know about the Book of Common Good
One and one is strictly forbidden
Ushers gonna miss you deep 'til it's over
One and one is strictly prohibited
You don't know how you gonna get over me
I'll be gone beepin like "OOH!"
And when I'm gone, I'm gonna bring the bad news
Good news, bad news, good news
We going to the doctor so the bad news can't reach
All the kids hurt, everybody hurt
I have no fear, all I need is strength
Go get help, go get help
all hospitals give us money
Weeping is the only medicine that's around
All of the bad news, good news, good news
We going to the doctor so the bad news can't reach
All the kids hurt, everybody hurt
I have no fear, all I need is strength
Go get help, go get help
all hospitals give us money
Weeping is the only medicine that's around
All of the bad news, good news, good news
We going to the doctor so the bad news can't go
All the kids hurt, everybody hurt
I have no fear, all I need is strength
Go get help, go get help
all hospitals give us money
Weeping is the only medicine that's around
All of the bad news, good news, good news
