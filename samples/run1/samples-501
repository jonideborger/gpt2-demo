[She take it back to the man]
She said, "I drink all of my wine"


[Verse 3]
So we gettin' it wrong 'bout the wrong people times
But we gots' instincts right
And we make mistakes, but we make ours right
So we cleaned up like New Yorkers
And know we screwed up more than your average tex-ter
Thats, but several sins, but the damage is done
And many your average drunkard
Hope to see you on the other side
She never again thought you'd have to deal with a drunkard
She had us so shocked, even more so
Thats right, but many ills, but the damage is done


[Bridge]
I was always doomed
To be anything but I know Lord


[Interlude: Kid Cudi]
Some day, some day, some day, some day
Some day, some day


[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Some day, some day, some day (Some day)
Some day, some day, I'll (Some day)
Some day, some day, and all my other nonsense (Oh)
They don't mean a thing, they don't even mean a thing
Most days, they don't even mean a thing
Oh yeah, they don't even mean a thing


[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
They don't mean a thing
(Oh) but they don't mean a thing
(C'mon) but they don't mean a thing
(C'mon) but they don't mean a thing
(Oh) but they don't mean a thing


[Interlude: Raekwon]
Some day I'll give you everything that's on the line
Some day I'ma raise the bar up
All over the place
I'll get you maced off
All day, all day, no rest
No rest, not even half of it
All day, all day, all day






[Intro: Kanye West]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I think I was almost perfect in Korea
At least I had a friend like George Foreman
Right now, I'm supposed to be apologetic
But in the end, it really hurt me to see him gone
Had some of my closest friends murdered, though
Told the minister I still bleed China
Had my heart tracked by the United States
They looking at me like I'm Tony holding my gold
Talked 'bout my three closest relationships
Ridin' something like Che Guevara
When I'm saying I'm sad, it's all because of you
They looking at me like I'm Lauryn Hill not me
I dunno, I'm just saying I'm more than happy to see you gone
I'm almost yanked out of my mother's arms
I'm almost yanked out of my room
I'm almost yanked out of your life
I'm almost yanked out of your dreams


[Chorus: Kanye West, Kanye West & Tony Williams]
Can I talk my way or can I?
Can I talk my way or can I?
Talk my way or my way my way



[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I let a lot of people go
Even if I let you know that I ain't throwing up
I'ma need to see your glasses off
Y'all always lookin' like they shouldn't be on
I don't cook or wash or do hair let me be
You should be able to say hi to ino
Anyone that's ever seen L.A. should know
They been handed millions and millions of dollars
And they't getting what they deserve
They been went to war and you can testify you know me
I am a full time housewife and we afford
And if I don't get paid I gotta go away
I'ma divide up the chicks that's in the hell
And if I don't get paid I gotta leave


[Chorus: Kanye West, Kanye West & Tony Williams]
Can I talk my way or can I?
Talk my way or can I?
Tell the world I'ma drop my accent
Say I'ma sell weed, at least crack more
Can I, Can I?


[Verse 3: Kanye West]
We throw this year's party in the city called for tonight
Yeah, the bridesmaid album, the waitresses dressin'
It's the bridesmaid album, yo, it's the bridesmaid album


[Outro: Kanye West]
Damn, some drunk and confused me
Before I get my mind together like this
How I get through this?
I got my mind really worked
