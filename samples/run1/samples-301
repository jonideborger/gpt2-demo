======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you don't really care what people say
Everything I want (You don't really care what people say)
Every single word(), worded it way way
I can't believe a nigga would do something a nigga-
You know how that word is supposed to affect a person?
I open my eyes and it starts to get really bad
How could you be so nice to a niggaz?
Every time I bitches, they playa yell at me
I asked 'em:
"Father, how you treating my son?"
But she just said, "He just bad at school"
You know how that goes, school's bad!
Then I just take it how it goes
She get interned at fast food places
She get screwed over her yoke, not me!
She get ripped off, not you!
"You nasty motherfucker!"
How that sound?
You don't take my word for it, don't you?
"What the hell do I know?"
If I'm not wrong, yeah!
"What do I need to know?"
If I'm up early for work, I can look ahead right now!
But I'm kinda behind more than I'll ever see!
"What do I need to know?"
If I'm behind, I'm not looking!
"What do I need to know?"
"What do I need to know?"
Ayy, um, to answer your question, I just opened up a private school
You know how that goes, it's good!








[Interlude: Kanye West & Kid Cudi]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Uh, praise the Lord and holle-than-any-body
The lord has given me the keys to heaven
So many keys that the lepers have not yet figured out
Unfolding, al'anna, the book of truths
Truth is power, yes, but only I know
Only I know, I know the truth


[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi]
Ain't nobody amazing, nobody amazing (A little glory)
But we at least try to something out
It mean something to everybody that hears us
There's nothing amazing about that
There's nothing amazing about that
It don't evenhin' good to be here
See, I don't know what y'all all about
I just been there, I wasn't lookin' for anything
Nothing strange, nothing unusual (Nothing unusual)
But there's something owwittin' about me
I don't know what y'all all about, maybe some day
Or be lookin' for these things, might be different
Unfolding, al'anna, the key to heaven
Truth is amazing, ooh


[Outro: The-Dream & The-Dream (with Steve Aoki)]
Yeah, that's that track, that's that track
Uhh, that's that wooah... woah
That's that deep, that deep, that deep
You need to pump your brakes, everybody, everybody (Everybody, everybody, yeah)
Don't get too hung up on this one at a time
This one's for the cars, this one's for the busses
You need to pump your brakes, everybody, everybody (Everybody, everybody, yeah)
Don't get too hung up on this one at a time
This one's for the cars, this one's for the busses
You need to pump your brakes, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, yeah
Uhh, that's that wooah... woah
That's that deep, that deep, that deep
You need to pump your brakes, everybody, everybody
Everybody, yeah
Uhh, that's that wooah... woah
That's that deep, that deep, that deep
You need to pump your brakes, everybody, everybody
Everybody, yeah






[Intro: Kanye West & Lil Wayne]
Uh, that's that Kanye West
That's that Kanye West
Uh, that's that


[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
I guess I got what it takes
To be a giant? A corporation?
And a man with a gun? Hmm
Ain't nobody amazing, nobody amazing
But we at least try to something out
There's nothing amazing about that
'Cause everything I'm not tryna be
I guess I got what it takes
To be a giant? A corporation?
And a man with a gun? Hmm
Ain't nobody amazing, nobody amazing
But we at least try to something out
There's nothing amazing about that
'Cause everything I'm not tryna be
I guess I got what it takes
To be a giant? A corporation?
And a man with a gun?
